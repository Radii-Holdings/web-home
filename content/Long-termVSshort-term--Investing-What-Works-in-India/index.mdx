## Short-Term Volatility vs. Long-Term Growth ðŸ’¡

### ðŸ“‰ Short-Term Performance (1 Month to 1 Year)

In the short term, the Nifty 50 has experienced negative returns:

- **1 Month Return**: **-2.91%**
- **3 Month Return**: **-3.98%**
- **6 Month Return**: **-5.01%**
- **1 Year Return**: **-6.27%**

These figures underscore the inherent volatility and risks associated with short-term investments in the Indian market. Factors such as global economic tensions, policy changes, and market sentiment can significantly impact short-term performance.

### ðŸ“ˆ Long-Term Performance (3 Years to 10 Years)

Conversely, a long-term perspective reveals positive returns:

- **3 Year Return**: **+14.00%**
- **5 Year Return**: **+11.00%**
- **10 Year Return**: **+8.00%**

This trend highlights the potential benefits of a long-term investment approach, where market fluctuations tend to even out, allowing the underlying growth trajectory to prevail.
